Hello World!  I find it fitting that my first entry here would start with "Hello World", since Hello World is usually
the first programming example of choice, and well most these posts will be centered around programming and technology.

I've had this desire to put together this website for quite sometime now, and i've finally gotten around to making it
happen!  I hope to showcase myself as a professional but more importantly, I hope this site can serve as a resource
for other professionals, and hobbyists alike.

The first set of posts will detail my journey in building MichaelArnel.com, going over in detail which tools I used and
and how, the options I explored and ultimately why I settled on the path I chose.

There are so many options to consider when sitting down to build a website.
    What programming languages will you use?
    How and where will it be hosted?
    What will it cost to run?
    Will it run server side code, or require database access?
These are some of the questions I had to answer when I committed mentally to building this site.

I'm not going to lie, when I first set off to build this website I had planned to use DurandalJS on the front-end, Node.js
on the back, maybe MongoDB for database storage, and then I went shopping for web host that could provide all these services.
